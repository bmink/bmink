Sr. Director Engineering @ [Gracenote](https://gracenote.com)

I used to be a whiz kid coder but now that I'm in engineering leadership, I very rarely write code for my job. I however still code and tinker a lot as a hobby. I'm also a woodworker and wood artist and sell my art at craft shows as well as do commission work.
